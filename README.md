ampersand-io-model
==================

Still under development.

Based on [ampersand-model](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-model) to be used with [socket.io](http://socket.io).
ampersand-io-model is an extension built on [ampersand-state](http://ampersandjs.com/docs/#ampersand-state) to provide methods and properties that you'll often want when modeling data you get from an API, using a realtime based socket app.

For further explanation see the [learn ampersand-state](http://ampersandjs.com/learn/state) guide.
